# Banquo
A .NET Framework to make Selenium more like CodeceptJS and Cypress.

This project is in **pre-Alpha** status - basically good enough for my own use currently.
If it gets a little more solid I'll put in some documentation maybe. Just what the
world needs right - another Selenium framework?

Oh, in case you aren't familiar with [Banquo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banquo "Wikipedia page"),
he's a ghost in Shakespeare's Macbeth. It was hard to find an unused ghost name for
automation tools.
